## ## Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease can help in taking preventive measures to reduce the risk. This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various health parameters.
